        <p>
          Numbers in the Bible often carry symbolic meaning beyond their mathematical value. 
          The study of these patterns is called biblical numerology. While interesting, 
          interpretation should always be grounded in sound scriptural context rather than 
          mystical significance alone.

        <p className="mt-2">
          <strong>Note:</strong> This tool currently uses a predefined database of biblical numbers and their significance.
          In the future, we plan to integrate with a Bible API to provide more comprehensive scripture references.
